Today we are releasing Deno 1.5.0. This release contains a few new fetaures,
many feature stabilizations, and a ton of bug fixes. Here are some highlights:

<!--TODO(lucacasonato): summary of highlights-->

If you already have Deno installed you can upgrade to 1.5 by running
`deno upgrade`. If you are installing Deno for the first time, you can use one
of the methods listed below:

```shell
# Using Shell (macOS and Linux):
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# Using PowerShell (Windows):
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

# Using Homebrew (macOS):
brew install deno

# Using Scoop (Windows):
scoop install deno

# Using Chocolatey (Windows):
choco install deno
```

# New features and changes

## New and improved bundling

Since the last release we have been hard at work to refactor our entire
TypeScript compiler infrastructure. Because of this we were able to replace our
aging bundling infrastructure with a new and shiny bundler based on
[swc](https://swc.rs/).

This has led to a **2x performance improvement** when we type-check your code,
and up to a **20x improvement** if you use the `--no-check` flag ðŸš€.

In addition to the performance improvements the bundler is now capable of tree
shaking your code. This means it will remove code from the bundle that you are
not actually using. This leads to a major size reductions in bundles. For
example a bundle of the
[file_server example](https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts) is **35%
smaller** in 1.5 when comparing to 1.4.

Bundles are now also emitted as a standard ES module, which means that dynamic
import will work correctly now, and `import.meta.url` is also set correctly. If
you were using Deno to bundle code for the browser, make sure to load the bundle
as an ES module now (`type="module"` attribute on your `<script>` tag).

## `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` added

This release adds the web platform APIs `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt`. These
have the same functions as they do in the browser:

- `alert` logs a message to the terminal, and then synchronously blocks until
  you confirm (with `[Enter]`).
- `confirm` prompts the user with a message, and then synchronously blocks until
  the user responds with either `y` or `n` (to signal `yes` or `no`).
- `prompt` requests some input from the user, and blocks synchronously until the
  user has entered the text and pressed `[Enter]`.

Here is a little demo of these functions in action. You can try it out by
running `deno run https://deno.land/posts/v1.5/alert_confirm_prompt.js`.

```js
let name = "";

while (true) {
  name = prompt("What is your name?");

  if (confirm(`Are you sure ${name} is your name?`)) {
    break;
  }
}

alert(`Hello ${name}!`);
```

## Improvements to the REPL

The REPL has gotten some great features this release. It was recently moved
fully into Rust to allow for better integration with V8. Here are some of the
highlights:

- **Tab completion of object properties and methods**: to use this, just press
  `Tab` to cycle through the list of properties and methods.
- **Code syntax highlighting**: code that you enter is now syntax highlighted if
  your terminal supports colors. You can disable this with the `NO_COLOR`
  environment variable.
- **Top level await support**: you can now just `await` promises in the REPL
  without having to wrap your call in an async IIFE.

In addition to the feature additions, the keyboard shortcut in the REPL have
changed. They now match the keyboard mappings in `bash`. To exit the REPL press
`^D` on an empty line, or enter `close()`. To clear the current line press `^C`.

## Stricter type checks

This release will enable the `isolatedModules` TypeScript compiler option for
all users by default. In the 1.4 release this flag was enabled for users using
`--unstable`. This option enables some stricter checks in the TypeScript
compiler that will likely lead to some new errors you have not seen before:

```
ERROR TS1205: Re-exporting a type when the '--isolatedModules' flag is provided requires using 'export type'.
```

These errors occur when interfaces or type aliases are re-exported. To fix the
error, change your re-exports to use `export type`. Example:

```ts
// Bad
export { MyType } from "./mod.ts";

// Good
export type { MyType } from "./mod.ts";
```

For now you can override this option in a `tsconfig.json`. The ability for you
to override this option will be removed in 1.6.
